Here's what I'm going for with the enemies..

First, I've thought about creating a separate Enemy class, but currently, it is declared as a struct inside R3Scene.

The enemies are generated at predefined points in the scn file, and they aren't modified whe they are out of view.
When they're in view, they move along a predefined path (apparently this is how it happens in the game?) unless their fixed variable is set. 
They have a field of view for detecting the player ship, and if the ship is within it's firing angle, it shoots Projectiles at a certain rate.
    (this could be simplified if we assume all ships face the -z direction (assuming the player is moving in the +z direction); then, they could just
    fire as long as they are in view.)

The lasers are Projectiles, which are just line segments as of now. They could be changed to meshes if we do well with this. The length of the laser is
determined by the enemy.

The enemies will be drawn and modified in a method separate from the scene graph drawing.

What do you think?

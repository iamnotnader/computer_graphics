Features I implemented:
Implemented networked multi-player
	-Bind UDP socket to port
	-Thread receive loop
	-Send game state to peer (transformation matrix, enemy data, etc..)
	-Receive game state from peer asynchronously
	-Update state

Implemented collision detection
	-Assume the ship to be a point
	-As the scene is rendered, check if ship point is inside any boxes
	-If it is, check how close it is to each face
	-Cut off movement in direction of face if within some epsilon
	-Add more control points to provide a better approximation
 
Configured other input devices to work with game
	-Use hid-wizard to interface
	-Use gamepad companion plugin to map voltages to keys

Implemented view-frustum culling
	-Check outside of view frustum
	-Cull z axis using bbox checks	


Helped with particle simulation.
	-Collisions, generation, culling, etc..
Helped with game levels
	-Designed large portions of all three levels

# This scene shows a mixture of primitives with different colors.
# It is the same as mixedprimitives1.scn, but with the primitives
# arranged in a deeper scene graph hierarchy.
# It is useful for testing ray-scene intersections 
# with scene graph recursion.  It also demonstrates how materials
# can be inherited from parent groups in the scene graph
